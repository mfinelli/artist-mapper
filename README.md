# Artist Mapper for Last.FM dataset

This library takes the flat json files of the [Last.FM dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm) and
makes them more usable by adding the information into a relational database (MySQL or MariaDB).

After compiling the files it is then possible to search Twitter for tweets about the songs that are supposed to be
related and see if we find that people are actually tweeting about the same songs or artists.

## Download

You can get the latest version of this source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/mfinelli/artist-mapper). Check out
a local copy of the files using git:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mfinelli/artist-mapper.git
```

### Twitter credentials

To get the tweet finder to work you will need to register a
[new Twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new). Then copy the file `credentials.rb.sample` to
`credentials.rb` (we have excluded this file from source control so that our own keys are not available to the public
at large). Once you've copied the file you should updated the constants with the strings that you can find on the
application page.

## Dependencies

The dataset can be downloaded from
[http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm#getting](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm#getting)

Project dependencies are handled with [bundler](http://bundler.io).

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Data is stored using MariaDB (or Mysql):

### Linux (e.g., Debian)

Use your package manager (e.g., apt).

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client
```

### OSX

Use e.g., [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```shell
$ brew install mariadb
```

## Usage

First make sure that the mysql server is running. Then start the console:

```shell
$ bundle exec ./console
```

Initialize the `ArtistMapper` class

```ruby
am = ArtistMapper.new
```

Create (or refresh) the database schema:

```ruby
am.create_schema!
```

Process the data:

```ruby
am.recurse!
```

Now it's time to see if we can get any useful information from the data:

```ruby
tf = TweetFinder.new
tf.find_tweets!
```

(Note that you could start this last process while the first is still running. It checks the database in small batches
and will quickly fall behind the mapping due to the rate limiting.)

Due to the way that the rate limiting is handled, it is possible that duplicate tweets will be added to the database
(meaning that they have the same content and are the same user). You can remove these tweets from the matches table:

```ruby
tf.purge_duplicate_matches!
```

Finally, in order to inspect all of the matches run:

```ruby
tf.report_matches
```

(If you save the return value to a variable you can call `count` on it to see how many track pairs have at least one
result.)
